# PAY.ID — Grant Outreach Email / DM Template

Subject: Grant Application — PAY.ID (Programmable Payment Identity Protocol)

Hello [Grant Committee / Name],

I’m building PAY.ID, an open-source protocol that introduces programmable and verifiable payment policy.

PAY.ID separates payment decision from execution, enabling deterministic off-chain rule evaluation with on-chain verifiable decision proofs.
It is non-custodial, ERC-4337 compatible, and designed as neutral infrastructure.

We are seeking grant support to continue protocol R&D, rule packs, and developer tooling.

Proposal and repository:
- Proposal: [link]
- GitHub: [repo link]

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
