# PAY.ID — 5 Minute Infra Pitch Script

Hi, I’m building PAY.ID.

PAY.ID is a programmable payment identity protocol. It doesn’t move money. It decides whether money should be allowed to move.

Today, payment policy is embedded everywhere: in smart contracts, backend services, and banking systems. That makes it expensive, rigid, and hard to audit.

PAY.ID separates decision from execution.

Rules are evaluated off-chain, deterministically, inside a WASM sandbox. The result is signed as an EIP-712 decision proof. Smart contracts or systems can verify that proof without trusting any backend.

PAY.ID is non-custodial, ERC-4337 ready, and extensible to fiat rails like QRIS.

This is not a consumer app. It’s infrastructure.

Funding will support protocol hardening, rule packs, and developer tooling.

PAY.ID enables safer, more composable payment systems.
